      <p>Hi! My name is Tony Martin, and I am a Computer Science major from Rose-Hulman. I am 18 years old and from the Northside of Chicago. I graduated from IMSA for high school after spending about half my time there online. I have had a data science internship at Climate Pros during my high school senior year. During my freshman and junior years, I also conducted research projects studying different fields of biology to varying degrees. I did not enjoy my studies in biology, so I decided to shift my focus to math and computer science.</p>
      <p>Some of my favorite hobbies are playing board games and watch TV shows. I play a wide range of board games, while my collection may be small, against many people ranging from online to in-person. My favorite game genre is social deduction, but my favorite board game is Cosmic Encounter, where different alien species work together and fight to conquer the galaxy. I typically watch animated TV shows, with some of my favorite shows being Gravity Falls, the Owl House, and Danny Phantom. I love shows with profound lore and sometimes puzzles that can build up fan theories to extraordinary heights. If you ever want to play board games or watch some TV shows, just let me know!</p>
