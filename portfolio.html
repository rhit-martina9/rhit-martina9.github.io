      <h1>Portfolio</h1>
      <p>I have performed various research projects and learned from, studied, and created computer science projects during my time at high school. I plan to continue to advance my knowledge to complete interesting and complex programs in the future.</p>

          <h2><a href="">Climate Pros' Watchtower</a></h2>

          <p>During my senior year, I took a data science internship at Climate Pros to assist in the development of their Watchtower 2.0 program and user interface. While the code was too advanced for me, I did pick up some invaluable machine learning knowledge that I can use toward future projects.</p>

          <p>During my junior year, I participated in a research project studying possible drug variations of Aricept to help slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. I worked with a partner over the course of the semester studying different protein structures that mirrored the affects of the Aricept drug but targetted more receptors in degenerative neurons.</p>

          <h2><a href="">Chemical Reaction Emulator</a></h2>
          <img src="images/portfolio/chemical-vials.jpg" alt="Colorful chemistry testing flasks, jar and tube paper cut outs by Bogdan Dreava from NounProject.com">
          <p>As apart of a Computational Science course, I created a Chemical Reaction emulator that could analyze an inputted reaction and provide a visual display, with accompanying graphs. While it only worked under certain and ideal scenarios, it can be modified to display more diverse or intricate reactions.</p>

          <h2><a href="">Projectile Motion Emulator</a></h2>
          <img src="images/portfolio/physics.jpg" alt="'Particle physics' by kevin dooley is licensed under CC BY 2.0">
          <p>Also apart of the Computational Science course, I created a physics simulator that could display an object in motion given a starting location and velocity in 3D space. I could also add springs to connect particles to each other, while also altering their mass.</p>

          <img src="images/portfolio/thor.jpg" alt="'Thor iPad wallpaper' by xploitme is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0">
          <p>In an Ancient World Religions and Philosophies course, I wrote and presented a project analyzing the mythological origins of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's interpretation of Thor and other Norse mythology. I went into deal analyzing the differences between the MCU version, original mythological text, and the Marvel comics version and possible reasons for the changes.</p>

          <h2><a href="">Alpha STEM Research Project</a></h2>
          <img src="images/portfolio/exercise.jpg" alt="Athlete examining his performance in sports science lab running on treadmill by Jacob Lund Photography from NounProject.com">
          <p>In my freshman year, I performed a guided research project studying the effects of physical performance on intelligence in high school students. I wrote a detailed research paper and presented the project under the guidance of the Lane Tech Alpha STEM program.</p>
